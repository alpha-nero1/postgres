# postgres

A repository to practice and explore postgres as well as SQL in general.
The repo and subsequent folders can act as a tutorial and you should be able to setup a working and thriving DB given the materials provided!

Each file has been marked with the corresponding section of the postgres docs, for more detailed synopsis/explanations I recommend visiting them.
